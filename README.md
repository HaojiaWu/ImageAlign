# ImageAlign
ImageAlign is a web application designed for image registration tasks. It uses Flask for its backend framework and leverages OpenCV for image processing. The app can be accessed at https://imgalign.haojia-wu.com.

The app currently supports four distinct methods for image registration: SIFT, ORB, ECC, and RANSAC. Each of these methods offers unique advantages in aligning and registering images based on various features and transformations. However, due to the limited computational resources available on the personal server hosting this app, it does not include deep learning-based methods (such as CNNs and GANs) for image registration.
